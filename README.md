# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree My Projects
My projects implemented during Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity

During the course of the Nanodegree in Deep Learning there are a variety of projects to complete, and in this repository I showcase those projects.
Each folder above contains a project, which in turn primarily consists of an IPython notebook.
